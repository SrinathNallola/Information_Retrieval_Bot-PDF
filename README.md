A Python application serves as a communication bridge between users and PDF documents. Users can interact with the application by asking questions in natural language about the content of the loaded PDFs.

Here are some key features and processes of the MultiPDF Chat App:

Interaction with Multiple PDFs: The app can interact with several PDF documents simultaneously, providing responses based on their content.

Natural Language Understanding: The app is designed to comprehend questions asked in natural language, making it user-friendly and accessible.

Utilization of Language Model: The PDF Chat App uses a language model to generate vector representations, also known as embeddings, of text chunks. This allows the app to understand and process the content of the PDFs effectively.

Responsive and Relevant Answers: By comparing user queries with the text chunks and identifying the most similar ones, the application generates accurate and relevant responses.

Please note that the application's responses are only as good as the information loaded from the PDFs, and it will only answer questions related to the content of the loaded PDFs.
